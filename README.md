# NukaColaSpaceRace 2018

This is our first game created during a multidisciplinary Game Project course, which is a part of the Game Design and Production master's programme at our university.

The game is not optimized for web browsers, so it might be slow/stuttering.

Our assignment was to clone the game mechanics and feel of an existing game.  
Our game is inspired by [Gravity Force](https://classicreload.com/gravity-force-1989.html), on which we added our own theme and made some extra features.
